#My first React Native App -CPAN 213

##Description
This is my first react native application created for "CPAN 213 - cross platform mobile application development".
It demonstrates setting up the React Native environment, customizing a basic app, handling errors, and pushing code to GitHub.

##My info:
Name: Aishwarya Chhablani
Student id: N01711300
Course: Cross Platform CPAN 213
Date: 16 Sept 2025

Features Impemented:
**Custom Welcome Screen** – Displays the course title and subtitle in a styled header.

- **Personal Information Section** – Shows your name, student ID, and program details.
- **Course Goals List** – Cleanly formatted list of objectives for CPAN 213.
- **Interactive Button** – Updates its label every time you press it, demonstrating state & event handling.
- **Consistent Styling** – Uses React Native’s `StyleSheet` for layout, colors, and typography.
- **Troubleshooting Practice** – Intentionally introduced a syntax error, observed the red error screen, then fixed it to watch the app recover.
- **Git & GitHub Integration** – Initialized a Git repo, committed changes, and pushed the project to GitHub with a clear README.
